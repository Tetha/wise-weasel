## Puzzle List

I don't want the puzzles of an act to be listed like this, because
that's a spoiler. I need to figure out a way to hide the puzzles.

Currently, I'm thinking:

 - Setup some wordlist of generic stuff + words / phrases
 - Mark each puzzle with a number of trigger phrases, like
   "play music", "anthem", "grammophone" for the music puzzle
   in Matryoshka. 
 - Present the player with a large cloud of words, with 1-2
   words per (unfound) puzzle, as well as a bunch of words
   from the list.
 - The player looks at this list, and if they
   recognize a word as something they are currently wondering
   about, they can click on this. If this matches a puzzle,
   the puzzle is revealed.
 - There should also be the usual "spoil me" button.
# Shortcomings

## Acts should be a DAG and not just a list

Currently I've hacked together that acts are just a list of acts.
The player marks a "last solved act" and acts before that are
displayed, and you can click on "I've solved this" to get to
the next.

This wouldn't work for more complex adventures:

- In Monkey Island 2, getting the pirate certificate unlocks
  3-4 islands and you can engage these islands in parallel

- In Day of the Tentacle, you eventually unlock the Chron-o-John,
  and this allows engaging with the past, present and future at
  the same time.

In these cases, the player should be able to mark the first pirate
island as "solved", and then all of the islands might pop up
as different sections.
