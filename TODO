## Acts should be a DAG and not just a list

Currently I've hacked together that acts are just a list of acts.
The player marks a "last solved act" and acts before that are
displayed, and you can click on "I've solved this" to get to
the next.

This wouldn't work for more complex adventures:

- In Monkey Island 2, getting the pirate certificate unlocks
  3-4 islands and you can engage these islands in parallel

- In Day of the Tentacle, you eventually unlock the Chron-o-John,
  and this allows engaging with the past, present and future at
  the same time.

In these cases, the player should be able to mark the first pirate
island as "solved", and then all of the islands might pop up
as different sections.
